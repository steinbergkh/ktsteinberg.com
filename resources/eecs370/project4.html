    Due: 6:00 pm, Friday, April 18, 2014</small>
    </h1>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to teach you about cache design and how a caching processor generates and services address references.
</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>In this project, you will simulate a CPU cache (unified instruction/data) and integrate the cache into a Project 1 (behavioral) simulator.  As the processor simulator executes an assembly-language program, it will access instructions and data.  These accesses will be serviced by the cache, which will transfer data to/from memory as needed.
</p>
<h2 id="cache-simulator">Cache Simulator</h2>

<p>The central part of this project is to write a function that implements a flexible cache simulator.  The cache function will be used by the processor simulation when the processor accesses addresses.  Your cache function should be able to simulate a variety of cache configurations.  Once integrated into your processor simulator, the program will be run as follows:
</p><pre>simulate program.mc blockSizeInWords numberOfSets blocksPerSet</pre>
<p>Your cache function should simulate a cache with the following characteristics:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal" style="width: 90%">
        <dt>WRITE POLICY</dt>
                <dd>Write-back</dd>
                <dd>Allocate-on-write</dd>

        <dt>ASSOCIATIVITY</dt>
                <dd>Varies according to the &quot;blocksPerSet&quot; parameter</dd>
                <dd>Associativity ranges from 1 (direct-mapped) to the number of blocks in the cache (fully associative)</dd>
        <dt>SIZE</dt>
                <dd>The total number of words in the cache is blockSizeInWords * numberOfSets * blocksPerSet</dd>
        <dt>BLOCK SIZE</dt>
                <dd>Varies according to the &quot;blockSizeInWords&quot; parameter</dd>
                <dd>All transfers between the cache and memory take place in units of a single block</dd>
        <dt>PLACEMENT/REPLACEMENT POLICY</dt>
                <dd>When looking for a block within a set to replace, the best block to replace is an invalid (empty) block</dd>
                <dd>If there is none of these, replace the least-recently used block</dd>
</dl>

<p>Make sure the units of each parameter are as specified.  Note that the smallest data granularity in this project is a word, because this is the data granularity of the LC-2Kx architecture.  blockSizeInWords, numberOfSets, and blocksPerSet should all be powers of two.  To simplify your program, you may assume that the maximum number of cache blocks is 256 (this small number allows you to use a 2-dimensional array for the cache data structure).
</p>
<h2 id="address-references">Origin and Servicing of Address References</h2>

<p>As the processor executes an assembly-language program, it accesses addresses. The three sources of address references are instruction fetch, lw, and sw. When the program starts up, it will initialize the memory with the machine-code file as in Project 1.  These initialization references should NOT be passed to the cache simulator; they should simply set the initial memory state. Each address reference should be passed to the cache simulator.  
</p><p>The cache simulator keeps track of what blocks are currently in the cache and what state they are in (e.g. dirty, valid, etc.).  To service the address reference, the cache simulator may need to write back a dirty cache block to memory, then it may need to read a block into the cache from memory.  After these possible steps, the cache simulator should return the data to the processor (for read accesses) or write the data to the cache (for write accesses).  Each of these data transfers will be logged by calling the printAction function (don&apos;t modify this code at all - but be sure to #include the correct headers):
</p><pre>
enum actionType
        {cacheToProcessor, processorToCache, memoryToCache, cacheToMemory,
         cacheToNowhere};
/*
 * Log the specifics of each cache action.
 *
 * address is the starting word address of the range of data being transferred.
 * size is the size of the range of data being transferred.
 * type specifies the source and destination of the data being transferred.
 *  cacheToProcessor: reading data from the cache to the processor
 *  processorToCache: writing data from the processor to the cache
 *  memoryToCache: reading data from the memory to the cache
 *  cacheToMemory: evicting cache data by writing it to the memory
 *  cacheToNowhere: evicting cache data by throwing it away
 */
void
printAction(int address, int size, enum actionType type)
{
    printf(&quot;@@@ transferring word [%d-%d] &quot;, address, address + size - 1);
    if (type == cacheToProcessor) {
        printf(&quot;from the cache to the processor\n&quot;);
    } else if (type == processorToCache) {
        printf(&quot;from the processor to the cache\n&quot;);
    } else if (type == memoryToCache) {
        printf(&quot;from the memory to the cache\n&quot;);
    } else if (type == cacheToMemory) {
        printf(&quot;from the cache to the memory\n&quot;);
    } else if (type == cacheToNowhere) {
        printf(&quot;from the cache to nowhere\n&quot;);
    }
}
</pre>
<h3 id="hints">Starting Hints</h3>
<p>Your code should behave exactly the same way as your project 1 code except  for memory accesses, so downloading and working on the <a href="http://eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs370/eecs370.w14/projects/ssol.c">Project 1 instructor solution</a> could save you some work. Additionally, writing the following two functions and replacing all your memory accesses with these function calls could simplify your code:
</p><pre>
int load(int addr); // Properly simulates the cache for a load from
                    // memory address &quot;addr&quot;. Returns the loaded value.

void store(int addr, int data); // Properly simulates the cache for a store 
                                // to memory address &quot;addr&quot;. Returns nothing.
</pre>
<p>Note: These suggestions are not enforced and are merely provided as hints.
</p>
<h2 id="test-cases">Test Cases</h2>

<p>An integral (and graded) part of writing your cache simulator will be to write a suite of test cases to validate any LC-2Kx cache simulator.  This is common practice in the real world--software companies maintain a suite of test cases for their programs and use this suite to check the program&apos;s correctness after a change.  Writing a comprehensive suite of test cases will deepen your understanding of the project specification and your program, and it will help you a lot as you debug your program.
</p>
<p>The test cases for this project will be short assembly-language programs that, after being assembled into machine code, serve as input to a simulator.  You will submit your suite of test cases together with your simulator, and we will grade your test suite according to how thoroughly it exercises an LC-2Kx cache simulator.  Each test case may generate at most 200 printAction statements on a correct simulator, and your test suite may contain up to 20 test cases. These limits are much larger than needed for full credit.
</p>
<p>Each test case will specify the cache parameters to use when running the test case.  These parameters will be communicated via the name of the test case file.  Each test case should have a 3-part suffix, where each part identifies a cache parameter and the parts are separated by periods:
</p>
<pre>anyName.&lt;blockSizeInWords&gt;.&lt;numberOfSets&gt;.&lt;blocksPerSet&gt;</pre>

<p>For example, the test case in Section 8 would be named &quot;test.as.4.2.1&quot;.  The combination of cache parameters should be legal (e.g. they should all be powers of two; numberOfSets and blocksPerSet should not exceed 256).  The instructor buggy simulators will not have error-checking bugs.  See Section 6 for how your test suite will be graded.
</p>
<p>Writing good test cases for this project will require careful planning.  Think about what different types of behavior a cache can exhibit and generate test cases that cause the cache to exhibit each behavior.  Think about how to test the various algorithms used in the cache simulator, e.g. LRU, writebacks, read and write hits, read and write misses.  As you write the code for your simulator, keep notes on different conditions you think of, and write test cases to test those conditions.
</p>
<h2 id="grading-formatting">Grading, Auto-Grading, and Formatting</h2>

<p>We will grade on the correctness of your cache simulator and the comprehensiveness of your test suite.
</p>
<p>To help you validate your project, your submission will be graded automatically, and the result will be mailed back to you.  You may then continue to work on the project and re-submit.  There is a limit of 3 submissions per day with feedback, all other submissions will be recorded but you will not receive feedback. The results from the auto-grader will not be very illuminating; they won&apos;t tell you where your problem is or give you the test programs.  The purpose of the auto-grader is it helps you know to keep working on your project (rather than thinking it&apos;s perfect and ending up with a 0).  The best way to debug your program is to generate your own test cases, figure out the correct answers, and compare your program&apos;s output to the correct answers.  This is also one of the best ways to learn the concepts in the project.
</p>
<p>The student suite of test cases for the simulator will be graded according to how thoroughly they test a cache simulator.  We will judge thoroughness of the test suite by how well it exposes potentially bugs in a cache simulator.  The auto-grader will correctly assemble each test case in your suite, then use it as input to a set of buggy simulators.  A test case exposes a buggy simulator by causing it to generate a different answer from a correct simulator.  The test suite is graded based on how many of the buggy simulators were exposed by at least one test case.
</p>
<p>Because all programs will be auto-graded, you must be careful to follow the exact formatting rules in the project description:
</p><ul>
<li>Don&apos;t modify printAction at all.  Download this handout into your program electronically (don&apos;t re-type it) so you avoid typos.</li>
<li>Check your program&apos;s output on the sample assembly-language program and output at the end of this handout.
</li><li>Don&apos;t print the sequence &quot;@@@&quot; anywhere except in printAction().  You may find the Project 1 printState function useful in debugging, but make sure to take out printState&apos;s @@@.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="turing-in-project">Turning in the Project</h2>

<p>Use the submit370 program to submit your files.  Here are the files you should submit:
</p><ul>
<li>cache simulator (part 4)
    <ul>
<li>C program for your simulator (name should end in &quot;.c&quot;)
    </li>
    <li>suite of test cases (each test case is an assembly-language program in a separate file).  Each test case should have a suffix which tells the auto-grader which cache parameters should be used when running that test case <a href="#test-cases">(see Section 5)</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 10px;">example:
</p><pre>submit370 4 simulate.c test1.as.4.2.1 test2.as.1.1.4 test3.as.2.8.2
</pre>
<p>Your simulator must be in a single C file.  We will compile your program on a Linux workstation using &quot;gcc program.c -lm&quot;, so your program should not require additional compiler flags or libraries.  Standard library headers do not require additional compiler flags or libraries. The official time of submission for your project will be the time the last file is sent. If you send in anything after the due date, your project will be considered late (and will use up your late days or will incur a penalty in your grade).
</p>
<h2 id="sample-program-output">Sample Assembly-Language Program and Output</h2>

<p>Here is a sample assembly-language program:
</p><pre>
sw      0       1       6
lw      0       1       23
lw      0       1       30
halt
</pre>
<p>and its corresponding output with the following cache parameters:
</p><pre>blockSizeInWords = 4, numberOfSets = 2, and blocksPerSet = 1</pre>

<p>Make sure you understand each of the data transfers and their order.
</p><pre>
@@@ transferring word [0-3] from the memory to the cache
@@@ transferring word [0-0] from the cache to the processor
@@@ transferring word [4-7] from the memory to the cache
@@@ transferring word [6-6] from the processor to the cache
@@@ transferring word [1-1] from the cache to the processor
@@@ transferring word [4-7] from the cache to the memory
@@@ transferring word [20-23] from the memory to the cache
@@@ transferring word [23-23] from the cache to the processor
@@@ transferring word [2-2] from the cache to the processor
@@@ transferring word [20-23] from the cache to nowhere
@@@ transferring word [28-31] from the memory to the cache
@@@ transferring word [30-30] from the cache to the processor
@@@ transferring word [3-3] from the cache to the processor
