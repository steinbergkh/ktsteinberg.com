Winter 2014
Due: 6:00 pm, Friday, Mar 14, 2014
Contest Part Due: 6:00 pm, Tuesday, Mar 18, 2014</small></h1>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>This project is intended to help you understand how procedure calls work in assembly language and to give you experience designing and optimizing a finite-state machine for a simple computer.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>This project has two parts.  In the first part, you will write an assembly-language program to recursively compute combination(n,r) (i.e., n choose r). In the second part, you will simulate the computer at a lower, more-detailed level. Essentially, you will describe a finite-state machine for the LC-2K in C.</p>

<h2 id="combination">Assembly-Language Program to Compute Combination(n,r) (30%)</h2>

<p>Write an assembly-language program to recursively compute combination(n,r), defined as:</p>
<pre>
combination(n,0) = 1
combination(n,n) = 1
combination(n,r) = combination(n-1,r) + combination(n-1,r-1);
0 <= r <= n
</pre>
<p>Here&#39;s a C function to do this; your assembly-language program may follow this logic closely.</p>

<pre>
int combination(int n, int r){
    if (r==0 || n==r) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return combination(n-1,r) + combination(n-1,r-1);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Note that the definition of combination(n,r) is recursive.  Your assembly-language program must also use a recursive function call.  That is, your program should have a function that calls itself twice (to compute combination(n-1,r) and combination(n-1,r-1)) and adds the results together.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the most efficient solution (e.g., n>9 will take a LONG time), but using recursion will help you understand assembly-language procedure calls and stacks.  Your program should load the values n and r from memory locations labeled "n" and “r" the result should be stored in register 3 when the program halts.
</p>
<p>Straightforward solutions are possible in about 45 lines.  If your program is significantly longer than that, you are probably doing something wrong.  Your program must be reasonably efficient, i.e., it must execute at most 5000 instructions for n=7, r=3 (this is several times slower than a good solution).</p>

<p>Passing parameters to subroutines can be confusing in assembly language. It&#39;s easiest if you make most registers callee-save so the caller can assume the subroutine leaves those registers unchanged.  These callee-saved registers are typically pushed on the stack at the beginning of the subroutine and popped off the stack just before the subroutine returns.</p>

<p>Not all registers can or should be callee-save, however.  For example, one register will contain the subroutine&#39;s return value.  Also, the jalr instruction used to return from the subroutine will leave a register with a different value than it held when the subroutine was called.</p>

<p>Here is a small LC-2K program that uses a subroutine call. It takes an input and calls a subroutine to compute the quantity 4*input. Register 1 is used to pass input to the subroutine; register 3 is used by the subroutine to pass the result back. The current top-of-stack (first empty location) is given by stack + register 5.</p>
<pre>
lw	0	1	input   	r1 = memory[input]
lw	0	4	subAdr 	prepare to call sub4n. r4=sub4n
jalr	4	7	call	sub4n; r7=return address; r3=answer
halt
sub4n	lw	0	6	pos1	r6 = 1
sw	5	7	stack	save return address on stack
add	5	6	5	increment stack pointer
sw	5	1	stack	save input on stack
add	5	6	5	increment stack pointer
add	1	1	1	compute 2*input
add	1	1	3	compute 4*input into return value
lw	0	6	neg1	r6 = -1
add	5	6	5	decrement stack pointer
lw	5	1	stack	recover original input
add	5	6	5	decrement stack pointer
lw	5	7	stack	recover original return address
jalr	7	4	return.  	r4 is not restored.
pos1		.fill	1
neg1		.fill	-1
subAdr	.fill	sub4n	contains the address of sub4n
input		.fill	10		input = 10
stack		.fill	0		beginning of stack (value is irrelevant)
stack1	.fill	0		lets us see stack+1 in simulation
</pre>

<p>The stack array starts at label "stack" and extends to larger addresses, so the label "stack" needs to be the last line in your program.</p>
<p>Make sure your assembly-language program works for the Project 1 solution assembler and simulator, since that&#39;s how we&#39;ll test it.  Programs that don’t work with the solution assembler/simulator will receive a 0.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<p>One difficult aspect of this program will be allocating variables in the 8 LC-2K registers.  To make your job easier, here are the register assignments we used--you may use these or choose your own.</p>
<pre>
r0  value 0
r1  n input to function
r2  r input to function
r3  return value of function
r4  local variable for function
r5  stack pointer
r6  temporary value (can hold different values at different times, e.g., +1, -1, function address)
r7  return address
</pre>
<p>To have printState print the contents of your stack, you can append a bunch of ".fill 0" at the end of your assembly program after the "stack" label.</p>

<h3 id="competition">Competition</h3>

<p>There is an optional competition this semester for designing an efficient solution to the combination program.  The fastest average across numerous inputs will win a prize.  The only rule is as follows:</p>

<p><i>You cannot return pre-computed values</i></p>

<p>Anyone who can beat a cycle count of <i>less than 110,000</i> for C(14,7) will receive 5 bonus points to the project.  Please note the competition will test more than just C(14,7), this bar is just to encourage you to attempt this efficient solution.</p>

<p>The final date of submission for the competition is Mar 18.  Note that this is after the project is due.  Please submit to 2z instead of 2c or 2s.</p>

<h2 id="registers">LC-2K Register Level</h2>

<p>Project 1 described the behavior (architecture) of the LC-2K.  In this project, you will describe an implementation of the LC-2K.  For this, you will need the registers present in the LC-2K.  The register-level diagram of the LC-2K is below:</p>

<p>LC-2K uses a system-bus to connect registers together. The lines and arrows in the project diagram show the paths that data can take through the system. This diagram does not show the control signals.  As an example of how data uses the system bus to move between registers, memoryData may drive the system bus and programCounter may latch the results.  Assume that a register can drive the system bus and have another load that data, all in one cycle.</p>

<p>The control unit (not shown) can read the current opcode bits of instrReg, the memory ready signal (see Section 6), and the aluResult register (i.e., test if aluResult is 0) to make decisions on what next state to go to. The control unit can read these values without using the system bus. See the example under item #1 in Section 5.</p>

<p>All registers (shaded boxes) can load and drive data (from and to where depends on the connections and arrows in the diagram). In addition, the programCounter can increment (without using the system bus or ALU), and the ALU can compute aluOperand + bus, aluOperand - bus,  ~(state.aluOperand & bus).  Note that ALU is not a register--it performs some function on the operands (i.e., you can’t say ALU=something, but you can say aluResult = aluOperand + bus.  instrReg can also drive a sign-extended version of bits 15-0 onto the bus (i.e., bits 15-0 are from instrReg, bits 31-16 are the same as bit 15).  Use convertNum(state.instrReg & 0xFFFF) for this sign-extension.</p>

<p><strong>HINT:</strong> Notice that the ALU does not have a comparison flag. So how can you check two registers&#39; contents for equality?</p>
<h1 id="fsm">Finite-State Machine Description (70%)</h1>

<ul class="list-unstyled">A finite-state machine describes in detail the order of events necessary to carry out the computer&#39;s instructions. As described in Chapter 4 of the course textbook, a "big-picture" look at the sequence of a generic instruction would be
<li>fetch the instruction from the memory,</li>
<li>decode the instruction and decide what to do,</li>
<li>execute the instruction, then repeat.</li></ul>

<p>Your job is to break down each of these steps and design a finite-state machine that shows all data transfers of each instruction.</p>

<p>You will use C to describe the finite-state machine.  Start with the code included below and add the part of the simulator that executes instructions (the "run" function in the Project 1 solution).</p>

<p>C makes it easy to dramatically expand the size of your finite state machine by using variables to implicitly create new states.  Therefore, we will place strict limits on how you will describe your finite-state machine in C. This will only apply for the part of the program that executes instructions (e.g., not for the code that loads the program). The code that executes instructions must obey the following rules:</p>

<p>Only use <code>if...else-if...else goto</code> for conditional execution (you may not use for, while, do, case, ?:). For example:</p>

<pre>
if ((instrReg>>22) == ADD) {
    goto add;
}
</pre>

<p>The only code inside the body of if and else statement should be a goto (and possibly debugging printfs).</p>

<p><strong>HINT:</strong> the finite-state machine should only have three types of if statements. One is for the instruction decode (the next state depends on the instruction); the second is to test if memory is ready (see Section 6); the third is for the branch instruction.</p>

<p>The goto represents the next-state function, hence there should be no code in a state after a goto section.</p>

<p>Every distinct state in the finite-state machine should have a label before the C statements in that state (and there should be no extra labels).  Since you can execute several different operations in a single cycle (i.e., a single state in the finite-state machine), not every line of C code will have a label.  For instance, to load the memoryAddress register from the programCounter (as part of the instruction fetch), your code would be:</p>

<pre>
fetch:
    printState(&state, "fetch");
    bus = programCounter;
    memoryAddress = bus;
</pre>

<p>You may only transfer data where there is a connection shown on the register diagram.  That&#39;s why the example above transfers the programCounter data to the memoryAddress register via the system bus.  There is no connection between memoryAddress and programCounter, so you may not say memoryAddress = programCounter directly.  This will help you to see what can and can&#39;t be donein a single cycle (e.g., you can&#39;t drive the system bus with two different values, but you can load multiple registers from the system bus).</p>

<p>You can&#39;t use the new value of a register until the cycle after you write it. For example, if cycle 1 is "A=B", then you can&#39;t use the new value of A until cycle 2. This is because A doesn&#39;t actually get written until the end of cycle 1/beginning of cycle 2.  In particular, remember that the control unit reads instrReg and aluResult, which are registers.  An "exception" to this rule is the return value of memoryAccess (see Section 6). In one cycle, you may call memoryAccess and then test the return value of memoryAccess to decide which state to go to next.  The reason for this "exception" is that the return value of memoryAccess is a signal, not the output of a register.</p>

<p>The only functions you may use are printf, memoryAccess, convertNum, and printState.</p>

<p>The only variables you may use are 1] the variables specified in the state structure, 2] a variable to hold the return value of memoryAccess, and 3] the value of the system bus.</p>

<p>You may use the normal arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) as well as the bit operations in C (& |, << >> ~).</p>

<p>You may use printfs wherever you want.</p>

<p>You must assume that at the end of any given instruction every register other than the programCounter and the register file could be reset.  This could happen if an interrupt were to occur.  In that case only the architecturally visible things (program counter and register file) would be reset to their proper values.  In other words, you may NOT start executing an instruction before the previous instruction finished.  This includes taking advantage of the next instruction&#39;s address being available on the bus at the end of the previous instruction.  You may not work on two different instructions in the same clock.</p>

<p>Given the above limitations, you must execute your program executing as few states as possible.  In other words, you must call printState() as few times as possible.</p>

<p>You may find that it is easy to somehow optimize between instructions. This was done in previous semesters.  Don&#39;t do it. (see rule 9, above)</p>

<p>As a good rule of thumb, every instruction, other than halt, should end in going back to the fetch state for the next instruction.</p>

<p>Your final implementation must be as efficient as possible without breaking any of the constraints. Make sure that your simulator simulates each instruction with the minimum number of cycles.</p>

<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>

<p>For Project 1, you implemented memory as a simple array and accessed it directly (e.g., by saying something like data=state.mem[address].  For this project, you will still implement memory as an array, but the method of accessing memory will be more strictly controlled.</p>

<p>You must use the memoryAccess function (included below) to read or write memory.  memoryAccess will often need to be called several times (over several cycles) before it successfully reads or writes memory; this models the delay involved in accessing memory.  Your finite-state machine will have to look at the return value to see if the memory was successfully accessed and either retry the memory access or proceed with the next state. If the return value is 1, then memoryData was successfully loaded (for reading memory) or copied into memory (for writing memory). If the return value is 0, then your finite-state machine should re-try the memory access.</p>

<p>Note that the only way to access memory is via memoryAddress and memoryData. For example, to write a memory location, you must load the memoryData register with the data to be written, load the memoryAddress register with the address to write to, then do the memory access by calling memoryAccess.</p>

<h2 id="running">Running and Demonstrating Your Program</h2>

<p>The function printState (included below) prints the state label and the current contents of all memory, registers, and internal registers.  Your program should call printState BEFORE executing each state (i.e., right after each label).  See the example in item #2 of Section 5.  Your program should also call printState just before exiting.  Your final state will look like this:</p>

<pre>halt:
    printState(&state, "halt");
    exit(0);
</pre>

<p>Your simulator should be run using the same command format specified in Project 1, that is:</p>
<pre>simulate program.mc > output</pre>

<p>You should use the solution assembler from Project 1 to create the machine-code file that your simulator will run (since that&#39;s how we&#39;ll test it).  Simulators that do not accept the right machine code format will receive a 0.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading, Auto-Grading, and Formatting</h2>

<p>We will grade primarily based on correctness, functionality, efficiency, and adherence to the stated limitations when describing the finite-state machine. If you have any doubts about what is an acceptable finite-state machine, ask an instructor during office hours.</p>

<p>To help you validate your program, your submission will be automatically run against several test cases, and the result will be mailed back to you.  You then have the option of correcting some problems and re-submitting.  The results will not be very illuminating; they won&#39;t tell you where your problem is or give you the test programs.  The main benefit of doing this is so you know to keep working on debugging your program (rather than thinking it’s perfect and ending up with a 0).  The best way to debug your program is to generate your own test cases, figure out the correct answers, and compare your program&#39;s output to the correct answers.  This is also one of the best ways to learn the concepts in the project.</p>

<p>To deter you from using the autograder as a debugger, you will receive feedback from the autograder only for the first THREE SUBMISSIONS on any given day.  That is, you will receive an e-mail with your score only three times on any given day.  All subsequent submissions will be silently graded.  Your final score will be derived from your overall best submission to the autograder.</p>

<p>Because all programs will be auto-graded, you must be careful to follow the exact formatting rules in the project description:</p>

<h3 id="grading-combination">COMBINATION</h3>
<p>Store the result in register 3.</p>
<p>The two input numbers must be in locations labeled "n" and "r" (lower-case).  Your submitted combination program can use any values for n and r.</p>

<h3 id="grading-simulator">SIMULATOR</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t modify printState or stateStruct at all.  Download this handout into your program electronically (don&#39;t re-type it) so you avoid typos.</p>

<p>Call printState once before each state executes and once just before the simulator exits.  Do not call printState at any other time.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t print the sequence "@@@" anywhere except in printState.</p>
<p>state.numMemory must be equal to the number of lines in the machine-code file.</p>
<p>Initialize the PC and the 8 LC-2K registers to 0. Do not initialize the internal registers (memoryAddress, memoryData, instrReg, aluOperand, and aluResult).</p>
<h2 id="turning-in">Turning in the Project</h2>

<p>Use the submit370 program to submit your files.  Here are the files you should submit for each project part:</p>

<ul><li>combination (part 2c)
a. assembly-language program for computing combination(n,r)</br>

example:
<pre>submit370 2c comb.as</pre></li>

<li>simulator (part 2s)
a. C program for your simulator (name should end in ".c")</br>

example:
<pre>submit370 2s simulate.c</pre></li></ul>

<p>Your simulator must be in a single C file.  We will compile your program on a Linux workstation using "gcc program.c -lm", so your program should not require additional compiler flags or libraries.</p>

<p>We will count the highest score that you receive as the final grade for the  project (i.e., not necessarily the score for the last submission). However,  if you submit after the deadline - you will use your late day(s) even if those  submissions have lower scores than those submitted before the deadline.</p>

<h2 id="code-gragment">Code Fragment for Simulator</h2>

<p>Here is some C code that may help you write the simulator.  Again, you should take this merely as a hint.  You may have to re-code this to make it do exactly what you want, but this should help you get started.  Remember not to change stateStruct, printState, or memoryAccess.</p>

<p>Since several people have requested this as a separate download, the code below  is also contained in the file <a href="http://eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs370/eecs370.w14/projects/fsm.c">here.</a> They are identical and you need only  either download the file or use the code below.</p>
